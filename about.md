I'm a software developer and technical writer based in Vancouver, Canada. I've worked at IBM, Nokia, HERE Technologies, and Electronic Arts, with a focus on API documentation, developer guides, and publisher support tutorials. I have a BSc in Computer Science with a minor in English Literature from the University of Calgary.
